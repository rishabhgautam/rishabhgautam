## 🧠 About Me  
With 14+ years of experience and 12+ years dedicated to Data Science & Advanced Analytics, I thrive at the intersection of strategy, scale and execution.  
I architect and operationalize AI/ML solutions that drive digital transformation — from large-scale segmentation for broadband/mobility customers, to real-time IVR-agent matching pipelines and generative knowledge-base automation.  

My core expertise spans:  
- **Model development & governance**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), managing bias, interpretability, responsible AI frameworks.  
- **Big Data & cloud**: Hive, Hadoop, Spark, AWS & GCP large-scale architectures, production MLOps/CI-CD/monitoring.  
- **Engineering to production**: Building pipelines; batch + streaming; parallel processing; Databricks & Delta Tables at scale.  
- **Business impact**: Translating analytics into personas, segments and customer-centric actions.

## 🚀 What I’m Working On  
- Real-time segmentation and matching for IVR & contact-centre scenarios — dynamically scoring personas and routing/triggering personalized actions.  
- Knowledge-base automation: Using GPT; identifying duplicate issues & resolutions; incorporating seamlessly into enterprise support.  
- Learning and leveraging LangChain & Agentic AI for next-gen conversational platforms.  
- Enhancing observability & safe-guarding in ML pipelines: drift detection, audit logs, fairness checks, logging, alerting.
