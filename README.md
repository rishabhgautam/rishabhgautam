## 🧠 About Me  
With 15 years of experience and 13+ years dedicated to Data Science & Advanced Analytics, I thrive at the intersection of strategy, scale and execution.  
I architect and operationalize AI/ML solutions that drive digital transformation — from large-scale customer segmentation, to **conversation intelligence for call centres**, real-time IVR–agent matching pipelines, and generative knowledge-base automation.  

My core expertise spans:  
- **Model development & governance**: Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs), managing bias, interpretability, responsible AI frameworks.  
- **Conversation intelligence**: Mining voice and chat interactions for intents, sentiment, next-best-action, QA/coaching signals and CX insights at scale.  
- **Big Data & cloud**: Spark, AWS & GCP large-scale architectures, production MLOps / CI-CD / monitoring.  
- **Engineering to production**: Building pipelines; batch + streaming; parallel processing; Databricks & Delta Tables at scale.  
- **Business impact**: Translating analytics into personas, segments, conversation insights and customer-centric actions.

## 🚀 What I’m Working On  
- Real-time segmentation and matching for IVR & contact-centre scenarios — dynamically scoring personas and routing/triggering personalized actions.  
- **Conversation intelligence stack**: Turning raw call transcripts into searchable insights, QA scores, agent coaching signals and CX dashboards.  
- Knowledge-base automation: Using GPT to identify duplicate issues & resolutions and incorporate them seamlessly into enterprise support.  
- Learning and leveraging LangChain & Agentic AI for next-gen conversational platforms.  
- Enhancing observability & safe-guarding in ML pipelines: drift detection, audit logs, fairness checks, logging, alerting.

## 📂 Selected Projects & Highlights  
| Title | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Conversation Intelligence Platform | Designed pipelines to process large volumes of call transcripts, derive intents, sentiment, agent actions and QA metrics, and surface insights for operations, collections and CX teams. |
| Automated Knowledge-Base System | Leveraged GPT API to parse millions of call transcripts, extract root causes & resolutions, dedupe similar issues, and update KB in near real-time with quality checks. |
| End-to-End MLOps Pipeline | Built in Databricks: ingesting 100k+ call records hourly, extracting summaries, customer intent & sentiment, writing to Delta Tables with full logging/error-handling. |
| Learning LangChain & Agentic AI | Deep-diving into foundations and building prototype agents to support conversational automation and directed knowledge flow. |
